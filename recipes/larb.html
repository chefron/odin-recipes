    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this fast, piquant weeknight meal, ground pork and green beans are stir-fried with plenty of ginger, garlic and chiles, and seasoned with soy sauce and coriander seeds. A big splash of rice-wine vinegar right at the end adds a hit of acidity, which balances the pork's richness. Serve this over rice or rice noodles to help absorb all the salty, spicy sauce. Slices of fresh tomato add a sweet juiciness that works well here. But if you don't have a ripe tomato, feel free to leave it out.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as peanut, sunflower or grapeseed, plus more if needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>8 ounces green beans, cut into ½-inch lengths</li>
        <li>2 red chiles, seeded or not, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander seeds, lightly cracked with a mortar and pestle or with the side of a knife</li>
        <li>¼ cup cilantro leaves and tender stems, chopped, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice-wine vinegar, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons soy sauce, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice or rice noodles, for serving</li>
        <li>Sliced tomato, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a 12-inch skillet or wok over medium-high heat for 1 minute, then add the oil and let heat for another 30 seconds — it should be hot but not smoking. Stir in pork and ¾ teaspoon salt, and cook, breaking up meat with a spoon, until browned and crisp, 6 to 9 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
    
        <li>Return pan to heat and add more oil if it looks dry. Stir in green beans, cook until they are crisp, tender and bright green, 1 to 3 minutes. Stir in chiles, ginger, garlic, coriander seeds and remaining ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute longer.</li>
     
        <li>Return pork to skillet, along with chopped cilantro, vinegar, soy sauce and sugar. Stir briefly to combine, then scrape into a serving platter.</li>
       
        <li>Sprinkle more vinegar and soy sauce on top to taste, then top with more chopped cilantro. Serve with rice, and sliced tomato, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
