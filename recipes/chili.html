    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I call this confetti chili because it's flecked with multicolored vegetables: golden corn, red peppers, orange carrots, and black and red beans. Together they add excitement and texture to the beefy flavor-packed base, while chipotle chili in adobo gives it a spicy, smoky kick.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
